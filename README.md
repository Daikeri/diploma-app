## The idea
Initially, this project acted as a thesis on the topic "Development of a service for personalized recommendations of media content". In addition to implementing a mobile application, my tasks included implementing a set of ML models, as well as writing a number of FastAPI/Ktor services to process user actions. At the moment, this project is more of a simulator for complex development of acquired skills in Android development.
